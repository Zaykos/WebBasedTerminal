# A docker dashboard with a web based terminal for containers 


A docker image relied on the docker.sock to create a Web terminal with a management platform.

The dashboard lets you choose wether you want to manage an already created container or search and build an image that is stored on https://hub.docker.com

And then create a container with the options you like from the image you built.
